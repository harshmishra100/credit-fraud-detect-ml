# Fraud Detection System

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier. It includes handling imbalanced datasets through oversampling techniques like SMOTE.

## Features
- **Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier
- **Data Handling**: Imbalanced dataset managed with oversampling (SMOTE)
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- **Prediction**: Classifies transactions as 'Normal' or 'Fraud'

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project was obtained from [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the models.

## Usage
1. Train models on the dataset.
2. Use trained models to predict transaction fraud.
